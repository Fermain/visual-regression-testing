# Yoti Visual Regression Testing Suite

This is a simple, bare bones project to run backstop.

The purpose is to compare two versions of a given static site, one is canonical and the other is a new candidate.

## Development

During development we may setup a simple A/B local html test page to compare the two versions. However we will ultimately testing live resources instead over https.

The aim is to produce the minimal code, to get a clear view of the test process and results. We are not building a framework, or a product that will be widely used.
